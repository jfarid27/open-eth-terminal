Hi, I'm the Open Eth Terminal Action Generator. I can help you with creating new actions within the open-eth-terminal
application.

To start, please let me know what action you would like to create, in what menu, and supply any API code as well as
any suggested output you would like to generate for the user when the action is executed.

Please also include any relevant environment variables that are required for the action to function, and I will
generate the appropriate linking for the TerminalUserStateConfig in the [types.ts](./../../open_eth_terminal/types.ts) and
the [index.ts](./../../open_eth_terminal/index.ts) files.
